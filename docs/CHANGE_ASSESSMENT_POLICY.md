# Change Assessment Board (CAB) Policy

## 📋 Overview
This document establishes the Change Assessment Board protocol for the Abilitix Admin UI project to ensure all code changes undergo proper risk assessment and approval before implementation.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Prevent production issues through proper risk assessment
- Ensure all changes are properly evaluated and approved
- Maintain system stability and security
- Provide clear rollback procedures

## 🔴 MANDATORY PROCESS
- **ALL code changes** must undergo risk assessment
- **HIGH/MEDIUM risk changes** require explicit approval
- **All assessments** must be documented and logged
- **No exceptions** - even small changes must be assessed

## 🚨 RISK CLASSIFICATION

### 🔴 HIGH RISK (MANDATORY APPROVAL)
- Authentication system changes
- Database operations
- Security-related changes
- API endpoint modifications
- Environment variable changes
- Redirect logic changes
- Session management changes

### 🟡 MEDIUM RISK (MANDATORY APPROVAL)
- Business logic changes
- UI/UX modifications
- Component structure changes
- API integration changes
- Error handling changes

### 🟢 LOW RISK (RECOMMENDED APPROVAL)
- Comments and documentation
- Code formatting
- Variable renaming (non-functional)
- Logging additions

## 📊 ASSESSMENT CRITERIA

- [ ] Does this change affect API responses?
- [ ] Does this change affect API authentication?

### Security Implications
- [ ] Does this change expose sensitive data?
- [ ] Does this change affect input validation?
- [ ] Does this change affect access controls?

### User Experience Impact
- [ ] Does this change affect user workflows?
- [ ] Does this change affect UI/UX?

## 🔄 PROCESS FLOW

1. **Change Request** → Submit change request
2. **Risk Assessment** → Evaluate risk level and impacts
3. **Approval** → Get required approvals
4. **Implementation** → Execute change with monitoring
5. **Monitoring** → Track for issues
6. **Documentation** → Log results and lessons learned

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### Immediate Rollback Triggers
- Authentication failures
- Database errors
- Security breaches
- System unavailability
- Data corruption

### Emergency Response
1. **Immediate rollback** using pre-defined procedures
2. **Impact assessment** of the issue
3. **Communication** to stakeholders
4. **Root cause analysis** after stabilization
5. **Process improvement** based on lessons learned

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

### Track These Metrics
- **Assessment Completion Rate:** Target 100%
- **Approval Rate:** Target 95%+
- **Rollback Rate:** Target <5%
