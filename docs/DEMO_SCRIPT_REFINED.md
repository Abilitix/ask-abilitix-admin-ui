## 📋 **Complete Script**

| Time | Visual Action (Screen Recording) | Voiceover (V.O.) Script |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00** | **Scene 1: The Pain (The "Zero" State)**<br>Show a desktop with a messy folder. Highlight a dense PDF (e.g., "Employee_Handbook_2024.pdf" or "API_Documentation.pdf"). Zoom in on the document icon. | **V.O.:** This is your knowledge base. A fifty-page PDF where answers go to die. When your team needs an answer right now... they guess. And guessing is risky. |
| **0:12** | **Scene 2: The Upload (Speed)**<br>Switch to Ask Abilitix Documents page. Show the clean, modern UI. Drag the PDF into the upload zone. Show the TUS upload progress bar moving quickly. Document appears in the list with status "Active". | **V.O.:** Let's fix it. I'm dragging that document into Ask Abilitix. Watch the upload—it's resumable, so even large files are reliable. |
| **0:25** | **Scene 3: The Magic Button (One-Click FAQ Generation)**<br>Mouse hovers over the prominent "Generate FAQs" button in the header. Click it. Show the document selection screen. Select the uploaded document. Click "Generate FAQs" with default settings. | **V.O.:** One click. That's it. Ask Abilitix is now reading, understanding, and extracting the FAQs your customers actually ask. |
| **0:38** | **Scene 4: The Inbox (AI-Generated FAQs)**<br>Transition to the Inbox. Show 10-15 perfectly formatted Q&A pairs with clean typography. Mouse scrolls through the list. Highlight one Q&A with a clear question and answer. | **V.O.:** Done. In under 30 seconds, we didn't just search the document. We generated the top FAQs that people actually ask. Every answer is ready for review. |
| **0:52** | **Scene 5: The Differentiator (Trust Through Citations)**<br>Click on one inbox item. The detail panel opens. Mouse hovers over the "Citations" section. Show the citation editor with document picker. Click a citation badge. Show the document name and page reference. | **V.O.:** But any AI can summarize. Ask Abilitix builds *trust*. Every answer comes with a receipt. We don't hallucinate; we prove it. If it's not in your docs, we don't say it. |
| **1:08** | **Scene 6: The Source Proof (One-Click File Open)**<br>In the citation section, show the document name as a clickable link. Click it. The original PDF opens in a new tab with the exact page highlighted. Zoom in on the highlighted text matching the answer. | **V.O.:** Click the source. See that? The exact page, the exact text. That's trust. That's governance. No black box. |
| **1:22** | **Scene 7: Governance in Action (Human Control)**<br>Return to Inbox. Click "Approve" on two good Q&As. They disappear from the inbox. Click "Reject" on one that seems irrelevant. Show the smooth UI transitions. | **V.O.:** You stay in control. You're the curator. Approve the good ones, reject the bad ones. It's your governed source of truth. |
| **1:35** | **Scene 8: The Live Widget (Instant Deployment)**<br>Transition to a mock company website. The Ask Abilitix chat widget is in the bottom-right corner. Click to open it. Type a question matching one of the approved FAQs. | **V.O.:** And just like that, you're live. Those approved answers are instantly available on your website. No deployment. No waiting. |
| **1:48** | **Scene 9: The Payoff (Trust in Action)**<br>The widget instantly provides the approved answer. Show the answer with a citation badge. Click the citation. Show the document name and page reference. Highlight the "Approved FAQ" label. | **V.O.:** An instant, verified answer, backed by your source data. Your customers see the citation. They see the trust. |
| **2:00** | **Scene 10: The Speed (Fast-Path Matching)**<br>Type another question in the widget. Show the answer appears instantly (no loading spinner). Highlight the "Approved FAQ" label again. | **V.O.:** And for approved FAQs, it's instant. No AI processing. No latency. Just pure speed. |
| **2:10** | **Scene 11: Outro & CTA**<br>Screen fades to the Ask Abilitix logo. Show a clean CTA: "Try with your own document." | **V.O.:** Stop digging through PDFs. Start delivering trusted answers. Go from zero to hero in minutes with Ask Abilitix. Try it with your own document today. |
